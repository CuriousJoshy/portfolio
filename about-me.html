                    <p>My name is Joshua Young and I am a part of the graduating class of 2019 at <em>Milwaukie High School</em>. I'm currently 17 years old and I'm an aspiring programmer who's passion is to create works I can call my own as well as extend upon the works of others. I've always had my heart set on designing and innovating in one way or another, though I could never fully pinpoint what it is I wanted to do. It wasn't until I started playing Minecraft, making complicated contraptions using redstone before my focus began to narrow down into three distinct fields: electronics, manufacturing/engineering, and programming.</p>

                        <h3>Programming</h3>
                        
                        <p>In regards to my focus on programming, my dad got me started with <em>Codecademy</em> around 7th grade where I eventually found myself enamoured with the power and creative freedom that programming provides. I went from course to course learning the fundamentals of <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>Javascript</strong> and using them as my personal playground for creating anything I had the skills to make. I initially used my skills to make little game programs for me to mess around with. In fact, until very recently, I was only really interested in making those said games often taking for granted the functional aspect of programming that I originally grew to love.</p>

                        <h3>Electronics and Engineering</h3>
                        
                        <p>My initial focus on electroncis as well as engineering sprouted during my freshman year where I had two electives regarding those fields: <em>Exploring Electronics</em> and <em>Manufacturing and Engineering</em>. While in Exploring Electronics., I absolutely loved desigining the circuit boards using ExpressPCB and I would aim to compact my design down to the limits of my ability. The problems came when I tried to physically produce what I had designed as I struggled again and again to make it come to fruition. The same can be said about Manufacturing and Engineering (excluding the welding part which I hated with a passion) since I had a ton of fun designing parts using SolidWorks. In the end, same as my experience in Exploring Electronics, I was terrible at milling out pieces evenly or precisely. As much as I enjoyed my time in both classes, this struggle signified to me that physically creating things is not my forte prompting me to return to my roots.</p>

                        <h3>Robotics</h3>
                        
                        <p>However, it was also during this time period that I joined the robotics team and became one of the programmers allowing me to gain an understanding of just how work goes into making even the most basic of contraptions. This was the first real taste of practical programming where I was able to be a part of as well as observe each individual aspect of development. The manufacturers were in charge of designing and modeling each piece of the robot making sure everything was structurally sound as well as making sure they was sufficient space for the electronics group to do their job. As their name entails, the electronics group was in charge of wiring each component of the robot to essentially the 'computer' and battery allowing the programmers to provide the necessary functionality for it to work out. Even though I struggled with the manufacturing and electronics side of development, I made leaps and bounds in my knowledge of programming fundementals in addition to how powerful programming can be in a practical sense when given the right tools and the right team. All in all, it was positive learning experience for me that has enabled to strive even further.</p>

                        <p>On the other hand, my sophomore year was a very lax one regarding my aspirations towards programming; It was my first year competing in sports where I played football and wrestled not to mention I also had my first actually tough class in Chemistry. I was also completely addicted to playing <em>League of Legends</em> during this time period and I played as much as I could as often as I could leaving little, if any, time for me to continue to develop my coding skills. In fact, I started becomming disinterested in programming also partially due to the fact I had burned myself out from the countless hours I spent doing nothing except that very thing. As a result, this was not a year where I made any real meaningful progress towards advancing my skills further.</p>

                        <h3>Junior Year</h3>
                        
                        <p>My junior year marked a turnaround from this mindset when I took the <em>Programming and Coding</em> elective which after a few weeks, despite being a class centered around <strong>Python</strong> via <em>CodeHS</em> and not my original 3 languages, rekindled my love for programming. Python itself was an interesting language to play around with since it had many nuances and much stricter syntax than Javascript meaning precision during the coding process was essential to avoiding a plethora of errors that would significantly slow down your progress. I continued to experiment with Python for most of the year before I finally decided to jump back into Javascript though, due to my time with Python, I was only really interested in the functional aspect of programming and almost completely disregarded the visual aspect save for the canvas element used in the vast majority of my projects.</p>

                        <h3>Senior Year</h3>
                        
                        <p>The momentum from junior year carried over into my senior year with my entrance into <em>Programming and Coding 2</em> which was focused around <strong>Java</strong>. After I completed the main curriculum of the class once again via CodeHS, I was able to explore the possibilities of backend programming since for the first time I had the power to both read and write files and use that power to make mini applications such as a simple text editor or, more ambitously, a tilemap editor for the games I liked to create. I eventually turned my attention back towards Javascript using my new found knowledge along with the resharpening of the programming fundamentals to create more solid and feature complete projects.</p>

                    <h2>The Future</h2>
                    
                    <p>Currently, I have been accepted into the co-enrollment program between Portland Community College and Portland State University where I will pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. As for deciding what my future career will be, that is still on the table with the closest thing to an idea being a Software Developer. My hope is that my studies in college will lead me to career opportunities through internships or other networking possibilities which I hope to take advantage of starting this coming fall. While my coding skills have developed greatly from where I began, I've seen just how limitless the possibilities are countless times in the work of others reminding me just how little I truly know. It is this revelation that has fueled my optimism for a higher education which I intend to use to the greatest of my ability. Until the time comes however, I will continue to improve my skills day in and day out as I have been in order to become the best I can possibly be.</p>
